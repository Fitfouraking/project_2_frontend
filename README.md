## Explanation
This a beer lover's tool. The app enables a user to search by a specific location, be it a bar or restaurant, and see the current list of beers on tap. Alternatively, a user can perform a search on an individual beer to see what locations nearby offer that beverage on draught. All beer lists are public in the sense that any user can contribute/update/delete the current draught list at a location - esentially crowd-sourcing the data in way that helps everybody stay as current as possible with search results.

### User Story:
Objective: Make a full stack app that shows users the draught beer list at a restaurant.

1.) User can search by location.
2.) User can search by beer name.
3.) User can search for beers to add to location's draught list.
4.) User can remove/delete beers to/from location's draught list.


### Unsolved Problems & Possible Bugs
Ultimately my goals are to tie in the BeerDB & Yelp API's to expand the user search capabilities (Yelp has location integration so that search results can be sorted by closest to user). Also, I want a user that searches by beer to be able to click on a specific location in that list to see the draught list (rather than having to go to the top and research that location). By adding user authentication down the road, I will enable users to add certain bars or beers to their "favorites" or "watchlist". This would also allow certain locations to privatize their accounts by becoming an admin (rather than having users manipulate their draught list).
